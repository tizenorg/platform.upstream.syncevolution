SyncEvolution synchronizes personal information management (PIM) data
via various protocols (SyncML, CalDAV/CardDAV, ActiveSync). It syncs
contacts, appointments, tasks and memos. It syncs to web services or
to SyncML-capable phones via Bluetooth.

Binaries are available for Linux desktops (using GNOME Evolution, or
KDE's Akonadi), for MeeGo and for Maemo 5 (Nokia N900).
