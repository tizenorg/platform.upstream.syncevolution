SyncEvolution SyncML Client

SyncEvolution synchronizes personal information management (PIM) data
like contacts, calenders, tasks and memos via SyncML. It supports all
of these for GNOME's Evolution and contacts for the system address
book of the Nokia 770/800 internet tablets, Mac OS X and (at one point) the
iPhone. The command-line tool 'syncevolution' (compiled separately for
each of these platforms) executes the synchronization. The 'sync-ui' is
a simpler (but also less powerful) GTK GUI for Linux.
