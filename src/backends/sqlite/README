This is a demo backend. It uses a database schema that is similar to
the one used on the iPhone, but it is not as complete.

To compile this backend as part of SyncEvolution, configure with
--enable-sqlite.

To compile it against a binary distribution of SyncEvolution, make
sure that the SyncEvolution, Synthesis and sqlite developer files are
installed and that pkg-config can find syncevolution.pc, synthesis.pc
and sqlite.pc. Set your PKG_CONFIG_PATH if necessary.

Then the source files can be compiled as follows:
   g++ -fpic -DPIC -DENABLE_SQLITE -shared -I. \
       `pkg-config --cflags --libs syncevolution`
       `pkg-config --cflags --libs sqlite`
       *.cpp  \
       -o /tmp/syncsqlite.so

Install /tmp/syncsqlite.so by moving it into the
"lib/syncevolution/backends" directory of the SyncEvolution
installation.

It then should show up as additional choice for the "type" property:
   syncevolution --datastore-property type=?

   SQLite Address Book = addressbook = contacts = sqlite-contacts
      vCard 2.1 (default) = text/x-vcard
