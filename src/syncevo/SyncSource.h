 * modified. Backup/restore is optionally implemented by this class if
 * pointers to SyncSourceRaw and SyncSourceDelete interfaces are
 * passed to init(). For backup only the former is needed, for restore
 * both.
 *
 * Potential implementations of the revision string are:
 * - a modification time stamp
 * - a hash value of a textual representation of the item
 *   (beware, such a hash might change as the textual representation
 *    changes even though the item is unchanged)
 *
 * Sync sources which want to use this functionality have to provide
 * the following functionality by implementing the pure virtual
 * functions below:
 * - enumerate all existing items
 * - provide LUID and the revision string
 *   The LUID must remain *constant* when making changes to an item,
 *   whereas the revision string must *change* each time the item is
 *   changed by anyone.
 *   Both can be arbitrary strings, but keeping them simple (printable
 *   ASCII, no white spaces, no equal sign) makes debugging simpler
 *   because they can be stored as they are as key/value pairs in the
 *   sync source's change tracking config node (the .other.ini files when
 *   using file-based configuration). More complex strings use escape
 *   sequences introduced with an exclamation mark for unsafe characters.
 *
 * Most of the functionality of this class must be activated
 * explicitly as part of the life cycle of the sync source instance by
 * calling detectChanges(), updateRevision() and deleteRevision().
 *
 * If the required interfaces are provided to init(), then backup/restore
 * operations are set. init() also hooks into the session life cycle
 * with an end callback that ensures that enough time passes at the end
 * of the sync. This is important for sync sources which use time stamps
 * as revision string. "enough time" is defined by a parameter to the
