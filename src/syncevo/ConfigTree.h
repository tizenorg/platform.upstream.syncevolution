/**
 * This class organizes the access to config nodes in a tree. Nodes
 * are identified by a relative path name, using a slash / as
 * separator between levels. Each node can have user-visible and
 * hidden properties. The two sets might be stored in the same
 * ConfigNode, i.e. properties should have unique names per node. For
 * each path there's also a second, separate namespace of key/value
 * pairs. The intented use for that is saving state by sync sources
 * close to, but without interfering with their configuration and the
 * state maintained by the client library itself.
 *
 * A ConfigNode can list all its properties while the tree lists nodes
 * at a specific level and creates nodes.
 *
 * This model is similar to the Funambol C++ DeviceManagementTree.
 * Besides being implemented differently, it also provides additional
 * functionality:
 * - the same node can be opened more than once; in the client library
 *   the content of multiple instances is not synchronized and changes
 *   can get lost
 * - nodes and the whole tree can be explicitly flushed
 * - it distinguishes between user visible configuration options and
 *   hidden read/write properties attached to the same path
 * - in addition to these visible or hidden properties under well-known
 *   names there can be nodes attached to each path which can
 *   be used for arbitrary key/value pairs; different "other" nodes can
 *   be selected via an additional string
 * - temporarily override values without saving them (see FilterConfigNode
 *   decorator)
 * - improved access to properties inside nodes (iterating, deleting)
