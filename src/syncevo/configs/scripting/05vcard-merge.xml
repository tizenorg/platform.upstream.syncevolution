   <!-- Special treatment of PHOTO data: keep a local file if it has the
        same content as the binary data in the winning item.
        Use in combination with a PHOTO field of type="string" (not blob,
        because we need to be able to compare the field in the MERGEFIELDS()
        call to detect when the data really changes) and compare="conflict"
        (not used to find matches, changes are relevant).
