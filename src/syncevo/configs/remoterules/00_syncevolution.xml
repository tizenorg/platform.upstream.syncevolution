      <!-- Merging between SyncEvolution instances is expected to work
           well, so allow the engine to update items on both
           sides also in the "non-first" slow sync case.

           This is turned off by default for other clients
           because small changes would propagate to other
           clients of the server. Hopefully with SyncEvolution as
           client we'll have not much such changes. -->
