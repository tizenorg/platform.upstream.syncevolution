    <!-- Due to a problem in M600i vCalendar implementation,
         the device does not calculate time zones correctly
         in all cases.
         If your M600i is brand new, you need to specify
         "calendar?/o(Z)" as database path instead of just
         "calendar". If your M600i has already been synced
         at least once via the cradle and the software
         delivered with the device, you must omit the
         "?/o(Z)" appendix and specify just "calendar" instead.
         Please also note that the o(Z) option for never-synced
         M600i devices only works if your server's config is
         derived from a recent version of our sample config.
         Otherwise, just make sure the M600i is synced once
         in the cradle before using SyncML.
