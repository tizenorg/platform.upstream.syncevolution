    <!-- Due to a problem in P900 vCalendar implementation,
         the device does not calculate time zones correctly
         in all cases.
         If your P900 is brand new, you need to specify
         "calendar?/o(Z)" as database path instead of just
         "calendar". If your P900 has already been synced
         at least once via the cradle and the software
         delivered with the device, you must omit the
         "?/o(Z)" appendix and specify just "calendar" instead.
         Please also note that the o(Z) option for never-synced
         P900 devices only works if your server's config is
         derived from a recent version of our sample config.
         Otherwise, just make sure the P900 is synced once
         in the cradle before using SyncML.
    -->
