The sample configs contain common elements (datatypes, scripts, remote
rules, debug settings) which are maintained as separate files in the
corresponding directories. When modifying those common elements, run
"update-samples.pl" in this directory to update the sample configs.

The complete samples are under version control for several reasons:
1. avoid dependency on Perl unless common elements need to be updated
2. effect of changes on complete config show up in patches
3. the file layout and unshared parts (<client> and <server>) are
   determined by the sample configs

The naming of common elements determines the order in which they get
inserted. Files not ending in .xml are ignored. Elements that only
apply to a client or server are stored in the corresponding sub
directories, while the shared elements are in the
"debug/scripting/datatypes/remoterules".

It is a somewhat subjective choice which elements are stored in one
file and which ones are split up. The three elements of a datatype
definition (field list, profile, datatype) where split up because
there might be multiple different profiles using the same field list
and some users of these files might want to replace the default one.
