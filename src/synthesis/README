Contributions
-------------
You are free to modify and distribute under the licenses indicated in
COPYING. As many other companies which dual-license their code, Synthesis
must be able to use all code in the upstream repository for their
commercial offerings. Therefore please sign the
   Synthesis_AG_Contributor_Agreement.pdf
and send it to Synthesis before submitting patches and code to Synthesis
for inclusion.

By doing so you simplify your own usage of the code (no need to merge
your changes with new upstream releases again and again) and ensure
that Synthesis will continue to release updates under an open source
license (we need to finance the development with sales from our commercial
products for commercial platforms and applications).

Synthesis is a small, entirely self-funded venture and the code that is
now becoming opensource is the work of 8 years focus on SyncML. So we count
on contributors to understand that in our own interest as well as the interest
of the project's future we need to be able to continue our commercial products
without complicating the process of developing them.
With the contributor agreement we can avoid the need for forking our internal
work into an open source branch and an internal branch, which would severely
reduce the possible output on the opensource branch. The contributor agreement
ensures we'll be able to share our internal progress in the project without
delay with the open source community.
