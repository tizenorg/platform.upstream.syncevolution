This is a copy of the libgdbus source code:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=bluetooth/libgdbus.git;a=summary

It is licensed under LGPL v2.1, see upstream COPYING.

The source is included here because there is no stable
upstream release. Patches added here need to be submitted
upstream. Likewise, patches applied upstream must be imported.
The build/import-gdbus.sh and build/export-gdbus.sh scripts
automate that process.

To import fixes from upstream:
- checkout out libgdbus and syncevolution
- enter syncevolution directory
- if not done before, create local "gdbus" branch:
  git branch gdbus origin/gdbus
- run build/import-gdbus.sh
- "gdbus" branch is now checked out and updated
- verify changes, merge into master, etc.
- push into remote syncevolution repo

To export fixes to upstream:
- check out relevant branch in syncevolution
  which has our local changes (typically "master")
- run build/export-gdbus.sh
- send 0*.patch files to upstream

Caveats:
- only files explicitly mentioned in the two scripts
  are imported/exports
- Makefile changes are only imported, but not exported
  (local changes not relevant upstream)
