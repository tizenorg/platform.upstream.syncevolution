This is a copy of the libgdbus source code:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=bluetooth/libgdbus.git;a=summary

It is licensed under LGPL v2.1, see upstream COPYING.

The source is included here because there is no stable
upstream release. Patches added here need to be submitted
upstream. Likewise, patches applied upstream must be imported.

The build/import-gdbus.sh script automates that process.
See build/import-foreign-git.sh for details.
