The documentation of .xml files follows dbus-introspect-docs.dtd
and uses spec-to-docbook.xsl from William Jon McCann <jmccann@redhat.com>
to convert the documentation into DocBook and then HTML.

See http://cgit.freedesktop.org/ConsoleKit/tree/doc/dbus for latest (?)
copy of the script and http://cgit.freedesktop.org/ConsoleKit/tree/src
for some examples.
