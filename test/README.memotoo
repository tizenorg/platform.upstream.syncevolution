Client::Sync::itodo20
Client::Sync::text

* Known Limitations or issues in memotoo server:
All
  -- If no data in memotoo server, it always initiates a slow sync. 
     This causes failures of testRefreshFromClientSync,testRefreshFromClientSemantic, testRefreshStatus,
     testOneWayFromServer.
vCard21
  -- Below properties are not supported:
     CALURI, FBURL, ROLE, X-MOZILLA-HTML, X-EVOLUTION-FILE-AS,X-EVOLUTION-BLOG-URL, X-EVOLUTION-VIDEO-URL, 
     X-ICQ, X-YAHOO
  -- Some extension properties are supported:
     X-AIM, X-ANNIVERSARY, X-ASSISTANT, X-MANAGER, X-SPOUSE
  -- The parameter 'X-EVOLUTION-URI-SLOT'of properties like 'TEL' and 'EMAIL' is lost
  -- 'PHOTO' is compressed by server but still be correct 
  -- 'FN' is not reserved and is replaced by the composition of 'N' 
  -- If 'ADR' has type information, then the last field value is lost
  -- All properties value has parser's bugs for escaped char "\;". This string is lost
  -- 'N' property lost "\;" if containing it
  -- ‘ORG’ only reserves its first and second fields ‘org name’ and 'department'
  -- 'URL' will be added 'TYPE=HOME' if no type information
  -- 'TEL' will be lost if it has only 'TYPE=PREF' information
  -- 'EMAIL' will be added 'TYPE=HOME' if no any type information
  -- For emails without type information, memotoo only preserves one of them 
  -- If 'X-GROUPWISE' is present, CATEGORIES will be set as the value of 'X-GROUPWISE' instead
  -- For the string "=3D0D=3D0A", which is encoded for "=0D=0A", it could not be treated as "\n".  
ical20
  -- Support iCalendar2.0
  -- Below properties are not supported by server:
     UID, SEQUENCE, TRANSP, X-EVOLUTION-ALARM-UID, RECURRENCE-ID, ORGANIZER
  -- Timezone related information isn't kept on the server and relative date-time is converted 
     into UTC time correctly, such as DTSTART, DTEND
  -- The 'UNTIL' component of the 'RRULE' property is converted to UTC time if it is floating time
  -- String "\\n" is interpreted as "\n"
  -- String "\\r" is interpreted as ""
  -- 'DESCRIPTION' in the 'VALARM' component is lost
itodo20
  -- Support iCalendar2.0
  -- Below properties are not supported by server:
     UID, SEQUENCE, URL
  -- 'PERCENT-COMPLETE' is set as '0' by default if absent
  -- 'CLASS' value is always changed to 'private' by server
  -- 'PRIORITY': Server only accepts 5 values, '1', '3', '5', '7' and '9'. Others will be converted into these
      values. Default value is '5'
text
  -- '<' and '>' in the plain text are converted to "&lt;" and "&gt;" separately
