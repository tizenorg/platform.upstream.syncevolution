CardDAV
=======

Not usable at the moment. Several valid test cases cause the server to
fail with a 500 error (Source::testImport) Other test cases with
special characters have these characters replaced.

Tests pass only because all the problematic test cases were removed.
See git log for testcases/yahoo_contact.vcf.

Other data changes seen in server:
* first component in ADR removed
* TYPE=CAR not supported in TEL, complete entry removed
* TYPE=PREF stripped from TEL
* TYPE=PARCEL;TYPE=POSTAL added to all ADRs
* no distinction between TYPE=HOME,FAX and TYPE=WORK,FAX,
  both become TYPE=FAX
* no TYPE at all for EMAIL
* only one level in ORG

It works a bit better with vCards encoded by Synthesis
(Sync::testItems): there's no 500 error. Apparently line folding
(enabled in Source::testImport test cases, disabled during sync) is
something that the server has problems with. But photos still get
lost.

Results for non-ASCII characters is inconclusive; testing is currently
disabled.
