* Know Limitations in Mobical server:
All
  -- If no data of any type of PIM in Mobical server, it always initiates a slow-sync. 
     This causes failures of testSlowSyncSemantic, testRefreshStatus, testDelete,
     testOneWayFromServer,testRefreshFromClientSync.
  -- It fails in xml mode due to devinfo wrapped with cdata type
     This causes failure of testItemsXML.
  -- Server initiates a slow-sync when one client syncs with server in one-way-from-client mode 
     from the second time.
vCard21
  -- Below properties are not supported:
     CALURI, CATEGORIES, FBURL, NICKNAME, X-MOZILLA-HTML, X-EVOLUTION-FILE-AS, X-AIM, 
     X-ANNIVERSARY, X-SPOUSE, X-EVOLUTION-BLOG-URL, X-EVOLUTION-VIDEO-URL, X-GROUPWISE, X-ICQ, 
     X-YAHOO, X-ASSISTANT
  -- The parameter 'X-EVOLUTION-URI-SLOT'of properties like 'TEL' and 'EMAIL' is lost
  -- 'FN' is not reserved and is replaced by server's composition of 'N' 
  -- 'NOTE' length is less than 4000
  -- vcard must have one of 'tel', 'email', or 'url','addr', otherwise, this vcard will 
     not treat as a full item and server won't send them to client when sync
  -- 'ADR' if it has no type information,
  -- 'N' has parser's bugs for escaped char "\;"
  -- 'BDAY' is always one-day behind the date client sends to server
  -- ‘ORG’ property only reserves its first field ‘org name’
ical20
  -- Only support vCalendar1.0
  -- Only Below properties are support by server:
     DTSTART, DTEND, SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION, LOCATION, CATEGORIES, LAST-MODIFIED, DCREATED, CLASS, RRULE, EXRULE, RDATE, EXDATE, DTSTART, AALARM, DALARM
  -- Below properties are lost by server though they are in the support list:
     CLASS, AALARM, DALARM
  -- Below properties are not accepted but in our test:
     TRANSP, SEQUENCE,UID,RECURRENCE-ID, ATTENDEE,ORGANIZER
  -- Timezone related information is lost by server: TZ, DAYLIGHT
  -- DTSTART, DTEND: if no timezone information and their value are not UTC time, server will convert them into UTC time according to your account timezone information
  -- If RRULE is 'yearly', server converts it into dayofyear mode. That is not supported by synthesis 
  -- The 'UNTIL' component of the 'RRULE' property is converted to UTC time if it is floating time
  -- The value of 'EXDATE' property is converted to UTC time if it is floating time
itodo20
  -- Only support vCalendar1.0
  -- Only below properties are supported by server:
     DUE, COMPLETED, LAST-COMPLETED, DCREATED, DALARM, AALARM, DESCRIPTION, SUMMARY, STATUS, CATEGORIES, PRIORITY
  -- 'PRIORITY': if value is '0', it is lost by server
  -- Below properties are not accepted but in our test:
     UID, DTSTART,PERCENT-COMPLETE,SEQUENCE, URL, CLASS
