This document is used to show interoperability test information with Nokia Ovi server.

* How to get the password
  Register your account at Ovi.com.
  Add your phone by Ovi.com->Login->Add Device.
  At the end of your adding device page, the synchronization configuration will
  be sent to your phone by mms but it also provides a 'Manual Setting' link which
  provides the synchronization password used to sync this device in case you
  could not receive the mms.
  Please use your Ovi user name and this per-device password for SyncEvolution.

* Data formats we need to test:
Client::Sync::vcard30

* Know Limitations in Ovi server:
The server is unstable, during testing, it returns '400' error from time to
time.
The authentication process need 3 retries to success.
Delete in normal sync (including two-way, one-way-from-client) does not 
effectively delete the data in the server, we can only use
(refresh-from-client). because of this limitation, many cases failed.

VCard30
  -- The server does not accept entries without an empty REV field.
  -- Below properties are lost:
     X-AIM X-EVOLUTION-UI-SLOT FBURL CALURI
  -- 'FN' value mismatch
  -- 'X-EVOLUTION-FILE-AS' mismatch, the server adds '\'
  -- 'ADR' only support maximum two fields
  -- Several fields is accepted by the server but do not send back to client (PHOTO, URL, EMAIL).
  -- Character 'Tab' in Note will confuse the server and causing value mismatch

* Known test failures:
Client::Sync::vcard30
  -- Client::Sync::vcard30::testRefreshFromServerSync,
     Client::Sync::vcard30::testComplexRefreshFromServerSemantic,
     Client::Sync::vcard30::testOneWayFromClient,
     Client::Sync::vcard30::testOneWayFromServer,
     Client::Sync::vcard30::testSlowSyncSemantic,
     Client::Sync::vcard30::testManyDeletes,     
     Client::Sync::vcard30::testDelete,     
     Client::Sync::vcard30::testDeleteAllSync,          
     Client::Sync::vcard30::testRetry,Client::Sync::vcard30::Suspend

Client::Sync::calendar+todo (vcalendar1.0)
EVENTS:
 --All day event not supported
 --Yearly recur and Monthly recur event not supported
 --'attendee' not supported 
 --The maxsize of an event items seems less than 512 (tested with
   MAX_ITEM_SIZE=512)
TODO:
 --Lost properties: SEQUENCE, PERCENT-COMPLETE
 --MISMATCH properties: DTSTART, COMPLETED; TODO only supports date not datetime

testDeleteAllRefresh, testItemsXML, testMaxMsg, testLargeObject these cases were 
tested OK sometime with serveral retires but the server is quite unstable and usually
failed with an unexpected response.

Also tried with icalendar 2.0 format which also works badly (all day event
recognized but with one additional day added, events with VTimeZone rejected by
server, some events have the closing date wrongly calculatd (seems treating
DTEND as inclusive).

Client::Sync::text
Reject contents, No devinfo. Items sent from client is rejected by server.
Adding a note from the web interface and try testFreshFromServerSync, the
server sends 1 item with empty content thus also rejected by our client.
