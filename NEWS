SyncEvolution 0.9 -> 0.9.1, 06.10.2009
======================================
Synthesis SyncML Engine version: see src/synthesis/ChangeLog

Mobical and Memotoo are now officially supported.

Memotoo uses vCard 2.1 with several Evolution specific extensions. It
uses iCalendar 2.0, however, without actually supporting the advanced
features of it. Times are converted to UTC and meeting information are
lost.

Mobical uses vCard 2.1 and vCalendar 1.0 as data formats, with the
result that many properties used in Evolution are not supported by the
server.  In particular calendar support is very limited (known issues
when events are in time zones different from the one selected locally
and on the server, no support for meetings). For details see
README.mobical.

*** Beware *** that the Mobical SyncML password is *not* the same as
the one for their web site. Log into mobical.net, the go to "my accounts
>> configure new device >> manual settings" to find the SyncML
credentials.

It is now possible to compile database backends outside of
SyncEvolution, install them and have SyncEvolution use them
automatically like any other backend. The backend API has been
enhanced considerably. Backend developers now have access to a modular
set of utility classes that can be mixed into a specific
implementation.

The sqlite demo backend can be enabled and compiled again with
--enable-sqlite. It demonstrates how to map directly from the
Synthesis field list to some internal format (an SQLite database
schema in this case).

Other changes:

* Resend messages to cope with intermittent loss of network
  connectivity (Moblin Bugzilla #3427). See the new "ResendDuration"
  and "ResendDelay" configuration properties for details.

* The logging of added and updated items was enhanced. Events,
  tasks and memos are logged with a short description instead of
  just the local ID. The description for contacts was improved.

* The sync UI allowed to enable calendar and task synchronization
  with Google although Google does not support that (MB#5871).
  In new installations this is prevented now by clearing the URI
  for those data categories.

* Importing work and home phone numbers from Google into desktop
  Evolution works better, because SyncEvolution now adds the "VOICE"
  flag expected by Evolution (MB#6501).

* SyncEvolution command line uses the GNOME keyring when
  the new --keyring option is given.

* SSL certificate checking with Google is enabled by default
  and enabled in Moblin, because libsoup in that distro has
  the necessary fix. Without that fix, all connection attempts
  fail. The binaries on syncevolution.org are compiled with
  --disable-ssl-certificate-check, so users who want the
  additional security must enable it.

* syncevolution.org binaries should be compatible with a wider
  range of Evolution releases again (MB#6552).

* Some sync UI enhancements (describe sync services, avoid crash
  with very long input in some of the text boxes (MB#5219), set
  application icon, improved some strings).

* Improved checks which logs in the logdir belong to the current
  server (MB#5215).

* Improved sanity checking of integer configuration parameters
  (MB#6500).

Known issue:

* Mobical and Memotoo do not have a description in the GUI yet.

* ZYB.com is not supported because of a known anchor handling
  problem in the server (MB#2424).


SyncEvolution 0.8.1 -> 0.9, 12.08.2009
--------------------------------------
Synthesis SyncML Engine version: see src/synthesis/ChangeLog

This is a major new release, with first steps towards further improvements.
From this release on, the Synthesis SyncML engine will be the
underlying SyncML and data conversion engine.

A native GTK GUI is now included. The "sync-ui" program depends on a
backend D-Bus service ("synevo-dbus-server") and several auxiliary
files. Therefore, it only runs without hacks after installation in 
/usr (possible with .deb, .rpm and binary .tar.gz archives, and
with "sudo make install", after compiling from source). The
normal command line tool still works without being installed.

In this release, the data handling model was changed from "all items
are sent verbatim to the SyncML server" to "parse and convert". The
argument for the former approach was that the SyncML server should be
the only entity in the system which does data conversion. The previous
releases already had to deviate from this approach to accommodate for
minor client/server incompatibilities and for vCard 2.1 support, so the
new approach just takes it one step further.

The main reason for going to full semantic conversion is vCalendar 1.0
support. Support by servers for iCalendar 2.0, the only format
supported by 0.8.1, is often still incomplete or even non-existent. By
doing the conversion on the client side, SyncEvolution is now able to
synchronize events and tasks with a wider variety of servers.

It is still true that properties not supported by a server cannot
be synchronized to other devices, so using a server with full
iCalendar 2.0 support is recommended. But in contrast to 0.8.1,
information that can be stored only locally is no longer lost when
receiving an incomplete update from the SyncML server, thanks to
intelligent merging, provided by the Synthesis engine. This depends on
an accurate description of the server's capabilities, which might not
be provided by all of them. This still needs to be tested in more detail.

Interoperability with servers tested extensively in this release.
The following servers are now supported:

* ScheduleWorld. There is very complete support for Evolution data. The
  only known issues are around resuming from an interrupted sync.

* Google contact sync.

  Google follows the vCard 2.1 specification, and thus does not support
  some of the vCard 3.0 additions, nor some of the common extensions. As
  a result, several properties are not synchronized (nickname, birthday,
  spouse/manager, URLs, ...). Only one top-level organization seems to
  be supported. For details, see README.google.

  Regarding Google's SyncML support, refresh-from-client and
  one-way-from-client sync modes are not supported. Deleting contacts
  moves them out of the main address without deleting them permanently. When
  adding such a contact again, the server discards the data sent by the
  client and recreates the contact with the data that it remembered.

  Because SSL certificate checking for Google works only with libsoup
  if the platform has a patched libsoup
  (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=589323) or libsoup >=
  2.28, certificate checking remains turned off by default for
  Google. If your platform has a suitable libsoup (like Moblin 2.0),
  then enable checking with:

  syncevolution --configure \
                --sync-property SSLVerifyServer=true \
                --sync-property SSLVerifyHost=true \
                google

* Funambol, with calendar and task support. Funambol supports iCalendar 2.0
  in the current server, so this is enabled in the configuration template.
  Not all iCalendar 2.0 features are supported by the server,
  most notably support for meetings (drops attendees), meeting
  invitations (drops UID), detached recurrences
  (drops RECURRENCE-ID). See README.funambol for details.

  Interoperability with the Funambol server was improved by adding
  support for some vCard extensions (X-MANAGER/ASSISTANT/SPOUSE/ANNIVERSARY,
  #2418). Lost ACTION property has a work around (#2422).

  To enable that support in an existing configuration so that it
  exchanges items in the more suitable iCalendar 2.0 format, use:

  syncevolution --configure --source-type sync=two-way \
                funambol calendar todo
  syncevolution --configure --source-type type='calendar:text/calendar!' \
                funambol calendar
  syncevolution --configure --source-type type='todo:text/calendar!' \
                funambol todo

  Without the exclamation mark, format auto-negotiation would pick the
  less capable vCalendar 1.0 format because that is marked as preferred
  by the server.


*** WARNING ***: After switching from a previous release to the
current one, or vice versa, do a "syncevolution --sync
refresh-from-server" or "--sync refresh-from-client" (depending on
which side has the authoritative copy of the data) once, to get client
and server into a consistent state. Not doing so can result in
applying the same changes to the server multiple times, and thus
duplicates.

Other changes in detail:

* vCalendar 1.0 is now supported.

* Both libcurl and libsoup can be selected at compile time as HTTP(S)
  transport mechanism.

* SF #2101015: Expect: 100-continue header results in 417 Error with proxy.
  Should no longer occur with the HTTP transports in this release.

* SF #1874805: Syncing with Funambol results in loosing all-day property.
  This now works thanks to the Synthesis data conversion rules.

* SF #2586600: Synchronisation with mobical.net fails in 0.8.1.
  Works now, but there are some known issues (Bugzilla #3009)
  and therefore mobical.net is not officially supported yet.

* SF #2542968: Separator for categories should not be escaped.
  Done correctly by the Synthesis vcard conversion.

* bug fix: Evolution notes with only a summary and no description were
  not sent correctly to the server. Instead of sending the summary,
  an empty text was sent. 

* CTRL-C no longer kills SyncEvolution right away. Instead it
  asks the server to suspend the session. If that takes too
  long, then pressing CTRL-C twice quickly will abort the sync
  without waiting for the server (Warning, this may lead to a
  slow sync in the next session).

* WBXML is enabled by default now, except for Funambol (#2415).
  Using WBXML reduces message sizes and increases parsing
  performance.

* New configuration templates can be added to
  /etc/default/applications/syncevolution. These templates may contain
  icons, which are used by the GUI (no icons shipped right now).

* Information about previous synchronization sessions is now stored in a
  machine-readable format and can be accessed using the new
  --print-sessions options. The output of this information is more
  complete and more nicely formatted.

* --status now shows not only data changes since the last sync, but also
  item changes (see README for the difference between the two).

* The new --restore option allows restoring local data to the state as
  it was before or after a sync. For this to work, "logdir" must be set
  (done by default for new configurations). The format of database dumps
  was changed to implement this feature. Instead of in a flat file,
  items are now saved as individual files in a directory. To get the
  previous format back (for example, to import as one .vcf or .ics file
  manually) concatenate these files.

* With –-remove, one can remove configurations. It leaves data files and
  the local databases untouched.


Known issues:

* The GUI includes the number of locally deleted items during a
  refresh-from-server sync in the number of "received changes"
  (#5185), which is a bit misleading. This is a result of #3314,
  which introduced changes not "received" from the server.

* When a network error occurs and the client
  never notices that the connection to the server was lost, 
  it will hang forever, waiting for the server's reply (#3427).

* The file backend now works only for data formats understood
  by SyncEvolution and the Synthesis engine. Items are parsed
  when exchanging them among the backend, engine, and server,
  in contrast to 0.8.1, where item content was not touched
  locally (#5046).

* The ZYB.com server sends conflicting sync anchors, so
  most syncs don't work as expected (#2424).


SyncEvolution 0.9 beta 3 hotfix -> 0.9 final, 12.08.2009
--------------------------------------------------------

Because SSL certificate checking for Google only works with libsoup if
the platform has a patched libsoup
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=589323) or libsoup >= 2.28,
certificate checking remains turned off by default for Google. If your
platform has a suitable libsoup (like Moblin 2.0), then enable
checking with:

  syncevolution --configure \
                --sync-property SSLVerifyServer=true \
                --sync-property SSLVerifyHost=true \
                google

Only minor changes:
* updated translations
* refresh-from-server syncs now report how many items were
  deleted locally at the start of the sync (Bugzilla #3314).
  The GUI includes the number of locally deleted items during a
  refresh-from-server sync in the number of "received changes",
  which is a bit misleading (#5185).
* fixed build issue on Fedora 11/g++ 4.4 (Bugzilla #5061)
* some build and test improvements
* proper fix for D-Bus error functions (#4919)
* improve sync-ui startup time by avoiding an unnecessary
  copying of the sync config into itself (#5021)
* adapted tooltip style (used for SyncML server links) to new
  Moblin theme, they weren't visible earlier (#5017)
* notify zone selector in Moblin 2.0 about sync-ui startup (#4752)
* sync-ui: minor layout change for fatal error situation


SyncEvolution 0.9 beta 3 -> 0.9 beta 3 hotfix, 23.07.2009
---------------------------------------------------------

Found additional Google limitation: the server drops photos if they
exceed a certain size. The limit is somewhere between 40KB (okay) and
80KB (dropped).

The last-minute workaround for Google/libsoup/gnutls (using http)
didn't work because apparently Google only supports SyncML over https
(Bugzilla #4551).  Now the default configuration template uses https
with all certificate checking disabled. A patch for libsoup was
submitted to upstream.

Some error messages by the "syncevolution" command line tool were not
printed (#4676). The root cause was the intentional interception of
stderr to hide the noise printed by various system libraries
(#1333). Unfortunately remarks about incorrect command line options
were among swallowed messages. No good workaround available short of
disabling the redirection with SYNCEVOLUTION_DEBUG=1, so let's release
an update...

Other changes:
* updated translations


SyncEvolution 0.9 beta 2 -> 0.9 beta 3, 21.07.2009
--------------------------------------------------
Synthesis SyncML Engine version: see src/synthesis/ChangeLog

Enabled calendar and task synchronization for myFunambol.com.
Not all iCalendar 2.0 features are supported by the server,
most notably support for meetings (drops attendees), meeting
invitations (drops UID), detached recurrences
(drops RECURRENCE-ID). See README.funambol for details.

Interoperability with the Funambol server was improved by adding
support for some vCard extensions (X-MANAGER/ASSISTANT/SPOUSE/ANNIVERSARY,
Bugzilla #2418). Lost ACTION property is worked around (#2422).

Synchronization with Google Contacts was enabled and tested.
A configuration template for that server is now provided. Google
follows the vCard 2.1 specification and thus does not support some
of the vCard 3.0 additions, nor some of the common extensions. As
a result, several properties are not synchronized (nickname, birthday,
spouse/manager, URLs, ...). Only one top-level organization seems to
be supported. For details, see README.google.

Regarding Google's SyncML support, refresh-from-client and
one-way-from-client sync modes are not supported. Deleting contacts
moves them out of the main address without deleting them permanently. When
adding such a contact again, the server discards the data sent by the
client and recreates the contact with the data that it remembered.

SSL certificate checking with libsoup (the default transport) is now
supported (#2431). However, libsoup/gnutls are very strict about SSL
certificate checking and reject version 1 certificates, like the one
used by Verisign for Google (#4551). At the moment the only solution
is to fall back to plain http in the Google configuration template.

CTRL-C no longer kills SyncEvolution right away. Instead it
asks the server to suspend the session. If that takes too
long, then pressing CTRL-C twice quickly will abort the sync
without waiting for the server (warning, this may lead to a
slow sync in the next session).

WBXML is enabled by default now, except for Funambol (#2415).
Using WBXML reduces message sizes and increases parsing
performance. It was not enabled initially in the 0.9 releases in order
to test this new feature more thoroughly. Old configs don't have an
explicit enableWBXML setting and therefore will automatically use the
new default.

Various bug fixes and improvements:

* only show servers in GUI which are tested and supported (Bugzilla #3336)
* a single log file is written in .html format (#3474)
* added several translations of the GUI
* lots of testing improvements, build binary packages again

UPGRADING

When enabling calendar and todo synchronization with Funambol
in an existing configuration, set the type so that iCalendar 2.0 is used:
  syncevolution --configure --source-type sync=two-way funambol calendar todo
  syncevolution --configure --source-type type='calendar:text/calendar!' funambol calendar
  syncevolution --configure --source-type type='todo:text/calendar!' funambol todo

When creating a configuration anew, this is not necessary because the
configuration template contains those types.


SyncEvolution 0.9 beta 1 -> 0.9 beta 2, 12.06.2009
--------------------------------------------------
Synthesis SyncML Engine version: see src/synthesis/ChangeLog

Major new feature: a GTK GUI! The "sync-ui" program depends on a
backend D-Bus service ("synevo-dbus-server") and several auxiliary
files. Therefore it only runs without hacks after "sudo make install",
in contrast to the normal command line which can be invoked directly.

New configuration templates can be added to
/etc/default/applications/syncevolution. These templates may contain
icons which are used by the GUI (no icons shipped right now).

Information about previous synchronization sessions is now stored in a
machine-readable format and can be accessed via the new
--print-sessions options. The output of this information is more
complete and nicer formatted.

--status now not only shows data changes since the last sync, but also
the item changes (see README for the difference between the two).

The new --restore option allows restoring local data to the state as
it was before or after a sync. For this to work, "logdir" must be set
(done by default for new configurations). The format of database dumps
was changed to implement this feature: instead of in a flat file,
items are now saved as individual files in a directory. To get the
previous format back (for example, to import as one .vcf or .ics file
manually) concatenate these files.

With --remove one can remove configurations. It leaves data files and
the local databases untouched.

Various bug fixes and improvements:

* compiles and works again on Debian Etch if Boost 1.35 is installed
  from www.backports.org (without GUI, see Bugzilla #3358)

* uses XDG_CACHE_HOME (= ~/.cache) for logs and database dumps to
  avoid interfering with .desktop search in XDG_DATA_HOME; the
  directory there is automatically moved when running syncevolution
  (Bugzilla #3309)

* re-enabled certain config options (clientAuthType, maxMsgSize, maxObjSize);
  normally it shouldn't be necessary to modify those (Bugzilla #3242, #2784)

* fixed error handling of unexpected server reply in libsoup transport
  (Bugzilla #3041)

* message logging is enabled at logLevel 3 (XML translation) and 4 (also
  original XML or WBXML message)

* GTK GUI fixes since initial Moblin 2.0 beta: only start it once if
  libunique is available (Bugzilla #3154), wrap text in change sync service"
  button (Bugzilla #2064), sort sources alphabetically in UI (Bugzilla #2070)


SyncEvolution 0.8.1 -> 0.9 beta 1, 13.05.2009
---------------------------------------------
Synthesis SyncML Engine version: see src/synthesis/ChangeLog

A major new release and the first step towards further improvements:
from this release onwards, the Synthesis SyncML engine is used as the
underlying SyncML and data conversion engine. The focus of this first
beta was to reach the same level of functionality and stability as in
0.8.1. Therefore this beta does not yet bring much new features; this
will be the focus of further beta releases until finally 0.9 will be a
full replacement for 0.8.1.

This release also switches from an "all items are sent verbatim to the
SyncML server" to a "parse and convert" data handling model. The
argument for the former approach was that the SyncML server should be
the only entity in the system which does data conversion. The previous
releases already had to deviate from this approach to accommodate for
minor client/server incompatibilities and for vCard 2.1 support.

The main reason for going to full semantic conversion is vCalendar 1.0
support. Support by servers for iCalendar 2.0, the only format
supported by 0.8.1, is often still incomplete or even non-existent. By
doing the conversion on the client side, SyncEvolution is now able to
synchronize events and tasks with a wider variety of servers.

It is still true that properties not supported by a server cannot
be synchronized to other devices, so using a server with full
iCalendar 2.0 support is recommended. But in contrast to 0.8.1,
information that can only be stored locally is no longer lost when
receiving an incomplete update from the SyncML server thanks to
intelligent merging provided by the Synthesis engine. This depends on
an accurate description of the server's capabilities, which might not
be provided by all of them - still needs to be tested in more detail.

*** WARNING ***: after switching from a previous release to the
current one or vice versa, do a "syncevolution --sync
refresh-from-server" or "--sync refresh-from-client" (depending on
which side has the authoritative copy of the data) once to get client
and server into a consistent state. Not doing so can result in
applying the same changes to the server multiple times and thus
duplicates.

Changes in detail:

* vCalendar 1.0 is now supported. Because this hasn't been tested that
  much yet, events and tasks are still disabled in the Funambol default
  configuration (SF #2635973).

* Both libcurl and libsoup can be selected at compile time as HTTP(S)
  transport mechanism.

* SF #2101015: Expect: 100-continue header results in 417 Error with proxy
  Should no longer occur with the HTTP transports in this release.

* SF #1874805: Syncing with Funambol results in loosing all-day property
  This now works thanks to the Synthesis data conversion rules.

* SF #2586600: Synchronisation with mobical.net fails
  Should work now because of the different SyncML implementation (untested).

* SF #2542968: separator for categories should not be escaped
  Done correctly by the Synthesis vcard conversion.

* bug fix: Evolution notes with only a summary and no description were
  not sent correctly to the server: an empty text was sent instead of
  sending the summary

Known shortcomings in this release which will be fixed before the
final 0.9:

* Verbatim file backups of items on the SyncML server are currently
  not possible: the SyncEvolution "file" backend still exists, but
  all items are converted by the Synthesis engine and therefore must
  be in a format supported by the engine.

* HTTPS can be used with libsoup, but certificate checking is always
  disabled. Need to find a portable way to determine where the
  certificate file is on various systems.

* Log file handling is not yet unified: the traditional client.log
  contains only high-level SyncEvolution log entries. Low-level
  SyncML and engine log entries are in sysync_*.html files.

* stdout and stderr messages from system libraries are visible on the
  console. 0.8.1 used to redirect those into the client.log to hide
  this noise; this will be added again. In the meantime, ignore
  messages like "Deadlock potential - avoiding evil bug!". This is
  liborbit telling us that it is (hopefully successfully) handling
  something nasty.


SyncEvolution 0.8.1 -> 0.8.1a, 15.12.2008
-----------------------------------------
C++ client library: 7.0 plus some patches, see github
repository referenced in configure script.

A minor bug fix release, updating only necessary on Mac OS X.

* #2307976 "Trace/BPT trap - sync failure": occurs randomly in
  Mac OS X specific transport layer of the Funambol C++ client
  library. Avoided in 0.8.1a by using libcurl as transport,
  as in 0.7.


SyncEvolution 0.8 -> 0.8.1, 11.10.2008
--------------------------------------
C++ client library: 7.0 plus some patches, see github
repository referenced in configure script.

A minor bug fix release, updating not really necessary.
The binary packages for Evolution are built now so that
one package works for all compatible Evolution releases,
including the new Evolution 2.24.

* Evolution calendar: regression in 0.8: one-way sync of virtual
  birthday calendar (#2095433). "refresh-from-client" works again
  for the birthday calendar. Other modes are not supported.
  In contrast to previous releases SyncEvolution now does some
  sanity checks that the sync mode is right.
* Mac OS X: removing old logdirs failed (#2087389). Fixed.
* SyncML client library: "Expect: 100-continue" header
  resulted in 417 error with certain proxies (#2101015).
  Now this header is always disabled; it doesn't make
  much sense with SyncML anyway.
* The development of the Funambol C++ client library is now
  tracked in a git repository on github.com. Modifications
  and tags for SyncEvolution are checked in there. The
  configure script checks out the right sources from there
  automatically; can be controlled via --with-funambol-src
  parameter.
* Evolution desktop: the version of the used Evolution libraries
  is included in the "--version" output and log files.
* Cleaned up README. Kudos to Martin Wetterstedt for pointing
  out mistakes in the README and the web site.


SyncEvolution 0.7 -> 0.8, 29.08.2008
------------------------------------
C++ client library: 7.0 plus compatibility patch for Synthesis

Updating user configuration: this version introduces a new, simplified
configuration layout. Old configurations still work. They can be
converted to the new format via a new "--migrate" command line option.

*** WARNING ***: this version uses a different change tracking for Mac
OS X address book, Evolution calendars, task lists and memos.  After
switching from a previous release to the current one or vice versa, do
a "syncevolution --sync refresh-from-server" once to reset the change
tracking. Not doing so can result in applying the same changes to the
server multiple times and thus duplicates.

* New configuration file layout: following the freedesktop.org
  recommendation, new configurations are stored in
  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/syncevolution or $HOME/.config/syncevolution if
  XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set. The old layout under
  $HOME/.sync4j/evolution is still supported.

* New command line options: new configurations can be created by
  syncevolution itself (--configure), including setting of all
  configuration properties (--sync-property, --source-property).
  The configuration can dumped to stdout (--print-config), with or
  without comments explaining each property (--quiet). See the
  README for details.

* The "evolutionsource" source property no longer has to be configured.
  If left blank, the default client database will be synchronized.

* Selecting which kind of data is to be synchronized under a specific
  source name is a lot easier now and the same on all supported
  platforms: the SyncEvolution backends can be selected via aliases
  (e.g. "contacts") and the format is specified via an optional
  MIME type (e.g. "contacts:text/x-vcard"). In the unlikely situation
  that multiple backends are active which can synchronize the same
  kind of data, then the right one can be selected by the unique
  name of the backend (e.g. "Evolution Address Book").

* New configurations automatically get a random client ID string.
  Setting it manually is still possible, but no longer necessary.
  Disabling unavailable data sources is also done automatically.

  SyncEvolution checks that the backend is available and there is
  at least one database (the first one will be synchronized unless
  explicitly changed). If these checks fail and the sync source was
  explicitly requested by the user by listing it after the server
  name, then an error is printed and no configuration is written.
  If the user wants the default setup, then the source is silently
  disabled.

* All passwords can be read from stdin at runtime or an environment
  variable (see "--sync-property password=?" or README for details).
  Both avoids the less secure storing of plain text passwords in the
  configuration files (SF #1832458).

* Detached recurrences: meeting series where some occurrences were
  modified are now supported. Previously only the main event was
  synchronized. All exceptions got lost when copying back from the
  server. Requires a SyncML server which supports this. ScheduleWorld
  was extended to do that.

* Fixed segfaults caused by logging certain data. The reason was an 
  API change in the client library's logging calls which the older
  SyncEvolution code hadn't been adapted to. Did not normally occur,
  but might have been the reason for SF #1830149 (unconfirmed).

* Time zone support: the time zones of incoming events are mapped
  to native time zone definitions whenever possible. Currently
  this works if the TZID follows the Olson naming scheme with a
  location at the end. Matching the time zone has the advantage of
  being able to update the time zone definition without having to
  recreate the event. If matching fails and the VTIMEZONE definition
  differs from one already imported earlier, then SyncEvolution works
  arounds limitation in Evolution by renaming the time zone.
  Previously the new event used the old and most likely out-dated
  time zone definition.

  ***WARNING***: Evolution itself does not do either of these steps
  itself yet, thus importing meeting invitations via Evolution still
  fails in some cases. The code implementing the time zone handling
  described above was written with inclusion into Evolution itself in
  mind; a discussion with the Evolution developers about that is in
  progress.

* On Maemo/Nokia Internet Tablets, calendar synchronization now
  works because the new calendar change tracking no longer depends
  on some of the backend calls which used to fail (SF #1734977).

* Added SSL configuration options: certificate checking can be
  relaxed or disabled completely (SF #1852647).

* Added a new file backend: stores each SyncML item as a separate file
  in a directory.  The directory has to be specified via the database
  name, using [file://]<path> as format. The file:// prefix is
  optional, but the directory is only created if it is used.

  Change tracking is done via the file systems modification time
  stamp: editing a file treats it as modified and then sends it to the
  server in the next sync. Removing and adding files also works.

  The local unique identifier for each item is its name in the
  directory. New files are created using a running count which
  initialized based on the initial content of the directory to
  "highest existing number + 1" and incremented to avoid collisions.
 
  Although this sync source itself does not care about the content of
  each item/file, the server needs to know what each item sent to it
  contains and what items the source is able to receive. Therefore
  the "type" property for this source must contain a data format
  specified, including a version for it. Here are some examples:
  - type=file:text/vcard:3.0
  - type=file:text/plain:1.0

* Code restructuring: it is now possible to add new backends and thus
  write SyncML clients for other kinds of data without touching any
  line of code in SyncEvolution itself. All the required interfaces
  are documented inside SyncEvolution itself. A HTML documentation can
  be built via the new "make doc" target (requires Doxygen and dot).

  The SyncEvolution framework itself never depended on GNOME or
  Evolution, only the Evolution data sources did. If you want
  support for other ways of storing your data, consider writing
  a new data source - it is really easy. See EvolutionSyncSource
  or TrackingSyncSource for details.

* Messages are printed to the screen immediately. More readable
  log file format.

* Maemo: the useless ''list: unable to access calendars:
  failure' error message is avoided. It was triggered by not having
  memo support in Evolution Data Server. Cleaned up the code so that
  it properly distinguishes between 'calendar', 'memo list' and
  'task list'.

* added server template for MemoToo; note that the server has not been
  tested

* added synchronization of Evolution memo summary

  Most devices only synchronize plain text and do not have a
  separate summary field. Such an extra summary field was added to
  Evolution after memo support was initially implemented in
  SyncEvolution, therefore SyncEvolution did not transmit that
  field.
  
  Added transmitting the summary by inserting it as first line of
  the plain text blob *if* it is not already identical with the
  first line. When receiving a memo, the summary is set from the
  first line *without* removing the first line because the first
  line might have been used as a normal part of the memo.

* Various other minor changes, fixes and lots of code cleanups.

* license cleanup: SyncEvolution is GPL v2 or later


SyncEvolution 0.8 beta 2 -> 0.8 final, 29.08.2008
-------------------------------------------------
C++ client library: 7.0 plus compatibility patch for Synthesis

* license cleanup: SyncEvolution is GPL v2 or later


SyncEvolution 0.8 beta 2 -> 0.8 beta 3, 17.08.2008
--------------------------------------------------
C++ client library: 7.0 plus compatibility patch for Synthesis

* Another revision of updating events in Evolution calendars:
  the method introduced in 0.8 beta 1 for dealing with
  detached recurrences did not work with the Evolution Exchange
  Connector. Now both Exchange and local calendars pass the unit
  tests again.

* minor code cleanup (testing, writing additional backends)


SyncEvolution 0.8 beta 1 -> 0,8 beta 2, 03.08.2008
--------------------------------------------------
C++ client library: 7.0 plus compatibility patch for Synthesis

* To prevent accidental sync runs when a configuration change
  was intented, a new --run switch must be used when configuration
  properties are given on the command line. When neither --run
  nor --configure are specified, SyncEvolution prints an
  error and refuses to do anything.

* Improved documentation for command line, in particular the synopsis.

* Added a new file backend: stores each SyncML item as a separate file
  in a directory.  The directory has to be specified via the database
  name, using [file://]<path> as format. The file:// prefix is
  optional, but the directory is only created if it is used.

  Change tracking is done via the file systems modification time
  stamp: editing a file treats it as modified and then sends it to the
  server in the next sync. Removing and adding files also works.

  The local unique identifier for each item is its name in the
  directory. New files are created using a running count which
  initialized based on the initial content of the directory to
  "highest existing number + 1" and incremented to avoid collisions.
 
  Although this sync source itself does not care about the content of
  each item/file, the server needs to know what each item sent to it
  contains and what items the source is able to receive. Therefore
  the "type" property for this source must contain a data format
  specified, including a version for it. Here are some examples:
  - type=file:text/vcard:3.0
  - type=file:text/plain:1.0

* Code restructuring: it is now possible to add new backends and thus
  write SyncML clients for other kinds of data without touching any
  line of code in SyncEvolution itself. All the required interfaces
  are documented inside SyncEvolution itself. A HTML documentation can
  be built via the new "make doc" target (requires Doxygen and dot).


SyncEvolution 0.8 alpha 1 -> 0.8 beta 1, 12.07.2008
---------------------------------------------------
C++ client library: the frozen 7.0 code, but before the release

* Added support for detached recurrences (aka modified instances of
  a recurring event). Requires a SyncML server which supports this.
  ScheduleWorld was extended to do that.

* Fixed segfaults caused by logging certain data. The reason was an 
  API change in the client library's logging calls which the older
  SyncEvolution code hadn't been adapted to. Did not normally occur,
  but might have been the reason for SF #1830149 (unconfirmed).

* when creating a config for the first time, only enable sync sources
  which can be synchronized (SF #1991286)

  The check for that was completely missing. Now SyncEvolution
  checks that the backend is available and there is at least one
  database (the first one will be synchronized unless explicitly
  changed). If these checks fail and the sync source was explicitly
  requested by the user by listing it after the server name, then
  an error is printed and no configuration is written. If the user
  wants the default setup, then the source is silently disabled.

* Fixed incorrect properties in some of the new server templates
  (ScheduleWorld syncURL + calender URI, Funambol syncURL, ScheduleWorld
   addressbook type)

* Device IDs must start with the "sc-pim-" prefix, otherwise myFUNAMBOL
  may treat different devices as the single phone that myFUNAMBOL
  supports, leading to unwanted slow syncs.

* Maemo package is build again so that backends are loaded dynamically:
  installing Dates application is as it was with the 0.7 release
  (SF #1993109). The useless ''list: unable to access calendars:
  failure' error message is avoided. It was triggered by not having
  memo support in Evolution Data Server. Cleaned up the code so that
  it properly distinguishes between 'calendar', 'memo list' and
  'task list'.

* added server template for MemoToo; note that the server has not been
  tested

* added synchronization of Evolution memo summary

  Most devices only synchronize plain text and do not have a
  separate summary field. Such an extra summary field was added to
  Evolution after memo support was initially implemented in
  SyncEvolution, therefore SyncEvolution did not transmit that
  field.
  
  Added transmitting the summary by inserting it as first line of
  the plain text blob *if* it is not already identical with the
  first line. When receiving a memo, the summary is set from the
  first line *without* removing the first line because the first
  line might have been used as a normal part of the memo.

* removed --properties option: it wasn't implemented yet and won't be in 0.8

* fixed regression in alpha 1: setting sync mode during status query
  or sync affected *all* sources, even the disabled ones. Now it only
  affects the enabled ones, as intended. To enable disabled sync sources,
  list them after the server name.

*** WARNING ***: this version uses a different change tracking for
for Mac OS X AddressBook. After switching from a previous release to the current
one or vice versa, do a "syncevolution --sync refresh-from-server"
once to reset the change tracking. Not doing so can result in applying
the same changes to the server multiple times and thus duplicates.

A similar change was necessary in 0.8 alpha 1 for Evolution calendar,
tasks, and memos. When switching from a version >= 0.8 alpha 1 to an
older version or vice versa also refresh the local databases.

0.8 alpha 1 did not create correct configurations. When you want to continue
using such a configuration, make sure that in addition to the obviously
wrong syncURLs also the less obvious ScheduleWorld config mistakes are fixed:
* calendar: uri=cal2
* addressbook: type=addressbook:text/vcard
* deviceId must start with "sc-pim-" if you synchronize with myFUNAMBOL,
  otherwise there may be unwanted slow syncs when multiple devices with
  a different deviceId connect. Note that changing the deviceId causes
  a slow sync, so you should get client and server in sync before changing
  the value, change it, then do a "--sync refresh-from-server".


SyncEvolution 0.7 -> 0.8 alpha 1, 19.04.2008
--------------------------------------------
C++ client library: a snapshot of the development version

Updating user configuration: this version introduces a new, simplified
configuration layout. Old configurations still work. They can be
converted to the new format via a new "--migrate" command line option.

*** WARNING ***: this version uses a different change tracking for
Evolution calendars, task lists and memos. After switching from a previous
release to the current one or vice versa, do a "syncevolution --sync
refresh-from-server" once to reset the change tracking. Not doing so
can result in applying the same changes to the server multiple times
and thus duplicates.

* New configuration file layout: following the freedesktop.org
  recommendation, new configurations are stored in
  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/syncevolution or $HOME/.config/syncevolution if
  XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set. The old layout under
  $HOME/.sync4j/evolution is still supported.

* New command line options: new configurations can be created by
  syncevolution itself (--configure), including setting of all
  configuration properties (--sync-property, --source-property).
  The configuration can dumped to stdout (--print-config), with or
  without comments explaining each property (--quiet). See the
  README for details.

* The "evolutionsource" source property no longer has to be configured.
  If left blank, the default client database will be synchronized.

* Selecting which kind of data is to be synchronized under a specific
  source name is a lot easier now and the same on all supported
  platforms: the SyncEvolution backends can be selected via aliases
  (e.g. "contacts") and the format is specified via an optional
  MIME type (e.g. "contacts:text/x-vcard"). In the unlikely situation
  that multiple backends are active which can synchronize the same
  kind of data, then the right one can be selected by the unique
  name of the backend (e.g. "Evolution Address Book").

* New configurations automatically get a random client ID string.
  Setting it manually is still possible, but no longer necessary.

* All passwords can be read from stdin at runtime or an environment
  variable (see "--sync-property password=?" or README for details).
  Both avoids the less secure storing of plain text passwords in the
  configuration files (SF #1832458).

* Detached recurrences: meeting series where some occurrences were
  modified are now supported. Previously only the main event was
  synchronized. All exceptions got lost when copying back from the
  server. ***WARNING***: such events are accepted by ScheduleWorld,
  but not propagated to other clients. Under investigation.

* Time zone support: the time zones of incoming events are mapped
  to native time zone definitions whenever possible. Currently
  this works if the TZID follows the Olson naming scheme with a
  location at the end. Matching the time zone has the advantage of
  being able to update the time zone definition without having to
  recreate the event. If matching fails and the VTIMEZONE definition
  differs from one already imported earlier, then SyncEvolution works
  arounds limitation in Evolution by renaming the time zone.
  Previously the new event used the old and most likely out-dated
  time zone definition.

  ***WARNING***: Evolution itself does not do either of these steps
  itself yet, thus importing meeting invitations via Evolution still
  fails in some cases. The code implementing the time zone handling
  described above was written with inclusion into Evolution itself in
  mind; a discussion with the Evolution developers about that is in
  progress.

* On Maemo/Nokia Internet Tablets, calendar synchronization now
  works because the new calendar change tracking no longer depends
  on some of the backend calls which used to fail (SF #1734977).

* Added SSL configuration options: certificate checking can be
  relaxed or disabled completely (SF #1852647).

* Adding support for new local data sources is easier now. The
  SyncEvolution frame work itself never depended on GNOME or
  Evolution, only the Evolution data sources did. If you want
  support for other ways of storing your data, consider writing
  a new data source - it is really easy. See EvolutionSyncSource
  or TrackingSyncSource for details.

* Messages are printed to the screen immediately. More readable
  log file format.

 * Various other minor changes and fixes.


SyncEvolution 0.6 -> 0.7, 17.12.2007
------------------------------------
C++ client library: r_6_5_3_1

Updating user configuration: no relevant changes in this release. For those
who haven't done so already, enabling large object support is recommended
(see syncml/config.txt sample configs).

* added port for iPhone and Mac OS X Address Book

* fixed Nokia packaging problem which prevented installation
  via the package manager unless it was in "red pill" mode
  (SF #1781652)

* sync with eGroupware - lost or messed up telephones: SyncEvolution
  incorrectly added TYPE=OTHER to phone numbers sent with e.g.
  CELL instead of TYPE=CELL (SF #1796086). Another patch was
  required for eGroupware itself to correctly map phone numbers
  as sent by SyncEvolution, see Compatibility web page.

* added .deb packages

* adapted calendar event insert/update to Evolution 2.12: the UID needs to be
  restored, otherwise the Evolution backend crashes (GNOME issue #488881)

* new feature: if the previous log directory is still available,
  then local changes made since last sync can be queried
  before starting a sync (new option --status) and will be
  printed directly before a sync. Setting the "logdir" option
  will automatically keep the most recent logs and database
  dumps around.

* added command line options:
  --sync|-s <mode>
    Temporarily synchronize the active sources in that mode. Useful
    for a 'refresh-from-server' or 'refresh-from-client' sync which
    clears all data at one end and copies all items from the other.

  --status|-t
    The changes made to local data since the last synchronization are
    shown without starting a new one. This can be used to see in advance
    whether the local data needs to be synchronized with the server.

  --quiet|-q
    Suppresses most of the normal output during a synchronization. The
    log file still contains all the information.

  --help|-h
    Prints usage information.

  --version
    Prints the SyncEvolution version.

* default configurations now reference the normal Evolution databases
  ("Personal") thus requiring less changes to use. The account information
  is now clearly marked as placeholder which needs to be entered.

* bugfix: vCard 3.0 with mixed case were not converted properly to vCard 2.1
  by SyncEvolution (must convert to upper case because vCard 2.1 only allows
  that), leading to problems with mapping phone numbers in the Funambol server.
  Diagnosed and reported by Paul McDermott, thanks a lot!

* support receiving plain text notes with \n and \r\n line breaks;
  always send with \r\n

* added explicit error message when syncevolution is invoked
  with incorrect names in the list of sources to synchronize:
  previously it silently ignored unknown names

* improved output: less verbose ("extracting" items is now
  logged at debug level and thus not normally shown) and more
  informative printing of changes (table summarizes number of
  changes on client and server, heading for comparison changed
  to make it clear that it shows changes on the client)

* SyncCap is not generated unless syncModes are configured: added
  a comment to example config (SF #1764123)

* improved error handling: catch errors during post-processing and
  continue


SyncEvolution 0.7-pre2 -> 0.7, 17.12.2007
-----------------------------------------
C++ client library: r_6_5_3_1

* bugfix: vCard 3.0 with mixed case were not converted properly to vCard 2.1
  by SyncEvolution (must convert to upper case because vCard 2.1 only allows
  that), leading to problems with mapping phone numbers in the Funambol server.
  Diagnosed and reported by Paul McDermott, thanks a lot!

* support receiving plain text notes with \n and \r\n line breaks;
  always send with \r\n

* added explicit error message when syncevolution is invoked
  with incorrect names in the list of sources to synchronize:
  previously it silently ignored unknown names

* added stack dumping in case of premature abort;
  removed workaround for lost connection to Evolution Dataserver
  again because the workaround itself caused random segfaults inside
  glib


SyncEvolution 0.7-pre1 -> 0.7-pre2, 08.11.2007
----------------------------------------------
C++ client library: branch b_v65

Updating user configuration: no relevant changes in this release. For those
who haven't done so already, enabling large object support is recommended
(see syncml/config.txt sample configs). It is required for myFUNAMBOL to
synchronize very large address books and some users have reported segfaults
unless this option was enabled.

* iPhone bug fix: syncing contacts with photos was unreliable (export) and
  crashed (import) because the API had not been called correctly

* iPhone + ScheduleWorld: when configured to use vcard3 (recommended!) then
  contacts are exchanged as vCard 3.0

* iPhone + ScheduleWorld bugfix: importing vCard 3.0 did not correctly
  classify the phone numbers. A sync with the new "--sync refresh-from-server"
  option will fix this, assuming that the server has the correct data.

* Evolution: detect a crashed backend and abort SyncEvolution instead of
  hanging forever.

* adapted calendar event insert/update to Evolution 2.12: the UID needs to be
  restored, otherwise the Evolution backend crashes (GNOME issue #488881)

* new feature: if the previous log directory is still available,
  then local changes made since last sync can be queried
  before starting a sync (new option --status) and will be
  printed directly before a sync. Setting the "logdir" option
  will automatically keep the most recent logs and database
  dumps around.

* added command line options:
  --sync|-s <mode>
    Temporarily synchronize the active sources in that mode. Useful
    for a 'refresh-from-server' or 'refresh-from-client' sync which
    clears all data at one end and copies all items from the other.

  --status|-t
    The changes made to local data since the last synchronization are
    shown without starting a new one. This can be used to see in advance
    whether the local data needs to be synchronized with the server.

  --quiet|-q
    Suppresses most of the normal output during a synchronization. The
    log file still contains all the information.

  --help|-h
    Prints usage information.

  --version
    Prints the SyncEvolution version.

* default configurations now reference the normal Evolution databases
  ("Personal") thus requiring less changes to use. The account information
  is now clearly marked as placeholder which needs to be entered.


SyncEvolution 0.6 -> 0.7-pre1, 17.10.2007
-----------------------------------------
* C++ client library: tag "sdkcpp_6_0_9_1" (same as before)
* added support for Mac OS X/iPhone address book
* fixed Nokia packaging problem which prevented installation
  via the package manager unless it was in "red pill" mode
* improved output: less verbose ("extracting" items is now
  logged at debug level and thus not normally shown) and more
  informative printing of changes (table summarizes number of
  changes on client and server, heading for comparison changed
  to make it clear that it shows changes on the client)
* example configs were in share/share directory (SF #1767329)
* Nokia 770/800: uninstallable package fixed by setting category
  (SF #1781652)
* sync with eGroupware - lost or messed up telephones: SyncEvolution
  incorrectly added TYPE=OTHER to phone numbers sent with e.g.
  CELL instead of TYPE=CELL (SF #1796086). Another patch was
  required for eGroupware itself to correctly map phone numbers
  as sent by SyncEvolution, see Compatibility web page.
* SyncCap is not generated unless syncModes are configured: added
  a comment to example config (SF #1764123)
* improved error handling: catch errors during post-processing and
  continue


SyncEvolution 0.5 -> 0.6, 13.07.2007
------------------------------------
* C++ client library: tag "sdkcpp_6_0_9_1"
* added support for synchronizing Evolution notes (aka memos) as
  plain text where the first line serves as summary; this is the
  format understood by ScheduleWorld
* added support for synchronizing Evolution notes (aka memos) as
  iCal 2.0 journal; not currently supported by any server and 
  untested
* revamped example configs and documentation: only one set of
  config files for each server is provided, because this is more
  likely to be needed by users
* example configs are now installed in share/doc/syncevolution,
  enabled message limit and large object support in them
* added support for Nokia 770/800 (aka Maemo):
  built with loadable modules so that it works with whatever
  backends are installed, improved log handling to accomodate
  for limited space on filesystem (see below), some workarounds
* added workaround for Nokia 770:
  contacts are not really deleted unless the EDS-Sync with
  instant messaging servers is activated; now SyncEvolution
  will delete contacts marked as deleted by the GUI before
  a sync if it finds any.
  WARNING: if you use EDS-Sync and SyncEvolution, then give
  EDS-Sync enough time after going online to finish its own
  synchronization of modified/deleted contacts before starting
  SyncEvolution.
* improved log handling: writing log and database dumps can be
  disabled with "logdir=none", verbosity of log is controlled by
  "loglevel", better handling of errors during initial database
  access
* added workaround for Evolution bug #455274:
  the separator for multiple categories in events and tasks
  is not generated and interpreted according to iCalendar 2.0
  by Evolution; as a consequence of that items sent to the server
  had all categories merged into one and items imported into
  Evolution only used one of the catories
  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=455274
* fixed off-by-one counting of months in backup directory names
* fixed error handling: a failed source was not forced into a slow
  sync as required; one failed source prevented saving configs of
  not-failed ones and thus forced those into an unnecessary slow
  sync
* uses the Funambol C++ testing framework (which is based on the
  previous SyncEvolution testing); now creates its configs
  and (when using CLIENT_TEST_EVOLUTION_PREFIX=file://<path>)
  also the Evolution databases automatically
* implemented synccompare as pure Perl script using Algorithm::Diff
  instead of external diff tool
* synccompare did not figure out width of shell window as it should have
* better error handling if creating the before/after database dumps
  fails (SF #1685637)
* workaround for Funambol 3.0 trailing = parser bug

UPGRADING

Old config files from 0.5 or older continue to work, but it is recommended
to set the following options to enable message size limits:
  maxMsgSize = 8192
  maxObjSize = 500000
  loSupport = 1


SyncEvolution 0.6pre2 -> 0.6, 13.07.2007
----------------------------------------
* improved README/HACKING documents
* fixed the new example configs: use event/task for Funambol 6.0,
  name was wrong
* added workaround for Evolution bug #455274:
  the separator for multiple categories in events and tasks
  is not generated and interpreted according to iCalendar 2.0
  by Evolution; as a consequence of that items sent to the server
  had all categories merged into one and items imported into
  Evolution only used one of the catories

  contacts are not really deleted unless the EDS-Sync with
  instant messaging servers is activated; now SyncEvolution
  will delete contacts marked as deleted by the GUI before
  a sync if it finds any.
  WARNING: if you use EDS-Sync and SyncEvolution, then give
  EDS-Sync enough time after going online to finish its own
  synchronization of modified/deleted contacts before starting
  SyncEvolution.


SyncEvolution 0.6pre1 -> 0.6pre2, 23.04.2006
--------------------------------------------
* C++ client library: tag "sdkcpp_6_0_7" + revision 1.7 of
  build/autotools/test/Makefile.am
* added support for synchronizing Evolution notes (aka memos) as
  plain text where the first line serves as summary; this is the
  format understood by ScheduleWorld, not the iCal 2.0 format
  added in 0.6pre1
* improved log handling: writing log and database dumps can be
  disabled with "logdir=none", verbosity of log is controled by
  "loglevel", better handling of errors during initial database
  access
* fixed off-by-one counting of months in backup directory names
* fixed error handling: a failed source was not forced into a slow
  sync as required; one failed source prevented saving configs of
  not-failed ones and thus forced those into an unnecessary slow
  sync
* revamped example configs: only one set of config files for each
  server is provided, because this is more likely to be needed
  by users
* uses the Funambol C++ testing framework (which is based on the
  previous SyncEvolution testing); now creates its configs
  and (when using CLIENT_TEST_EVOLUTION_PREFIX=file://<path>)
  also the Evolution databases automatically


SyncEvolution 0.5 -> 0.6pre1, 26.03.2006
----------------------------------------
* C++ client library: CVS snapshot from 26.03.2006
* added support for synchronizing Evolution notes (aka memos) as
  iCal 2.0 journal
* added --enable-static-cxa = linking C++ runtime statically:
  binaries produced for 0.6 will have less external
  dependencies than the 0.5 binaries
* added hacks for Maemo/Nokia 770, including a build
  mode with dynamically loadable modules (--enable-shared, --enable-maemo,
  --with-patched-dbus)
* implemented synccompare as pure Perl script using Algorithm::Diff
  instead of external diff tool
* synccompare did not figure out width of shell window as it should have
* better error handling if creating the before/after database dumps
  fails (SF #1685637)
* example configs are now installed in share/doc/syncevolution,
  enabled message limit and large object support in them
* workaround for Funambol 3.0 trailing = parser bug

UPGRADING

Old config files continue to work, but it is recommended
to set the following options to enable message size limits:
  maxMsgSize = 8192
  maxObjSize = 500000
  loSupport = 1



SyncEvolution 0.4 -> 0.5, 12.11.2006
------------------------------------
* C++ client library revision "syncevolution-0-5":
  - added support for sending changes in smaller chunks
    ("Large Object Support"): disabled by default, see updated
    example configuration
  - time is printed with GMT offset so that a server admin in
    a different timezone can always figure out how a client log
    relates to events on the server
  - special item keys as they might be stored in some calendars after
    importing non-Evolution events are now properly supported
* bug fix: in 0.4 it was necessary to manually configure the verDTD
  or the Funambol 3.0a server would choke on the invalid SyncML during
  the second synchronization with SyncEvolution; now this option is set
  automatically
* added support and testing of transmitting just the changes
  from client to server or vice versa; see "one-way-from-server/client"
  in example configuration
* fixed/updated comments in the example configuration
* improved automated testing and fixed the problem that CPPUnit was not
  found unless it was part of the system
* Now works on Maemo/Nokia 770: minor changes were necessary so that
  the system address book can now be selected under the name "<<system>>.
  Copying 300 contacts into the Nokia 770 went fine, but any further
  attempt to synchronize suffered from timeouts inside the embedded
  Evolution Data Server.


SyncEvolution 0.3 -> 0.4, 11.09.2006 
------------------------------------
* C++ client library revision "syncevolution-0-4":
  - added support for device information, required by some servers
  - fixed incompatibilities with non-Funambol servers
  - the user agent string can now be modified in the
    spds/syncml/config.txt, but it is recommended to not set
    it explicitly. Then SyncEvolution will automatically insert
    its current version.
  - #305795: for tasks the "text/x-todo" type from the configuration
    was sent to servers instead of the correct "text/calendar"
    provided by SyncEvolution itself
  - sync modes "refresh-client/server" can now be specified as
    "refresh-from-client/server" in the config
* updated default syncml/config.txt:
  - firstTimeSyncMode has never been implemented in the library,
    removed its documentation,
  - added documentation for userAgent
  - use "refresh-from-client/server"
* SF issue 1511951: support copying changes back from EGroupware
  server by not expecting the UID of calendar items to be unmodified
* fixed a bug where after a refresh-from-client sync changes would
  be sent to the server again during a two-way sync although the
  server already had them
* implemented authentication for Evolution databases
* synccompare was removing too many parts of vCards with 
  single-value ORG properties
* improved error reporting when selected server is not configured
* changed vCard parser to make it compatible with servers
  which send a verbatim semicolon as part of properties where
  the semicolon has no special meaning
* If minor errors occur like not being able to insert an
  item at the client or server side, then it is reported in the
  log and output, but the next synchronization will be a normal
  synchronization, not a forced slow one as in previous versions.
  The old approach ensured that the problem was noticed and fixed,
  but required user assistance. With the new approach synchronization
  continues to work, although without fixing the root cause of
  the problem.
* Workaround for bug in Evolution 2.0.6 (and perhaps other versions):
  for calendars and task lists not all deleted items were reported
  at once thus a single synchronization would only tell the server
  about a subset of the changes. Repeating the synchronization would
  eventually be told of all changes, so now this repetition is built
  into the code which queries for changes and a single synchronization
  is sufficient as it should be.


SyncEvolution 0.4 pre2 -> 0.4, 11.09.2006 
-----------------------------------------
* adapted to C++ client library from CVS head, tagged as syncevolution-0-4:
  devinfo.patch patch was merged with several changes to the API
* SF issue 1511951: support copying changes back from EGroupware
  server by not expecting the UID of calendar items to be unmodified


SyncEvolution 0.4 pre1 -> pre2, 21.08.2006
------------------------------------------
* C++ client library revision "syncevolution-0-4-pre2":
  most patches were merged into CVS head, but .patches/devinfo.patch
  still needs to be applied manually when checking out from the
  Funambol CVS instead of using the bundled version
* fixed a bug where after a refresh-from-client sync changes would
  be sent to the server again during a two-way sync although the
  server already had them
* implemented authentication for Evolution databases
* synccompare was removing too many parts of vCards with 
  single-value ORG properties
* improved error reporting when selected server is not configured
* use 7-bit quoted-printable encoding with explicit UTF-8 charset for
  vCard 2.1 to avoid any potential confusion about the content; not
  really necessary because SyncML specifies 8-bit UTF-8 as the default
* fix for 0.4 pre 1: sending CHARSET is not allowed (and not
  needed) for vCard 3.0, so it was removed again (did not harm
  either)
* fix for 0.4 pre 1: sending vCard 2.1 to Synthesis server did
  not work because the new device info always mentioned 3.0 as
  the preferred format - now the preferred format matches the one
  that was configured and that thus will be used.


SyncEvolution 0.3 -> 0.4 pre 1, 2006-08-06
------------------------------------------
* C++ client library revision "funambol30ga" plus the patches
  stored in its ".patches" directory:
  - the user agent string can now be modified in the
    spds/syncml/config.txt, but it is recommended to not set
    it explicitly. Then SyncEvolution will automatically insert
    its current version.
  - now compatible with additional servers (fixed some SyncML
    protocol issues, added support for sending device
    information)
  - revised API of the client library
  - #305795: for tasks the "text/x-todo" type from the configuration
    was sent to servers instead of the correct "text/calendar"
    provided by SyncEvolution itself
  - sync modes "refresh-client/server" can now be specified as
    "refresh-from-client/server" in the config
* updated default syncml/config.txt:
  - firstTimeSyncMode has never been implemented in the library,
    removed its documentation,
  - added documentation for userAgent
  - use "refresh-from-client/server"
* changed vCard parser to make it compatible with servers
  which send a verbatim semicolon as part of properties where
  the semicolon has no special meaning
* If minor errors occur like not being able to insert an
  item at the client or server side, then it is reported in the
  log and output, but the next synchronization will be a normal
  synchronization, not a forced slow one as in previous versions.
  The old approach ensured that the problem was noticed and fixed,
  but required user assistance. With the new approach synchronization
  continues to work, although without fixing the root cause of
  the problem.
* Workaround for bug in Evolution 2.0.6 (and perhaps other versions):

  eventually be told of all changes, so now this repetition is built
  into the code which queries for changes and a single synchronization
  is sufficient as it should be.
* Made it compile on Maemo 2.0, the Nokia 770 build environment, by
  adding "--disable-ecal". Not tested yet, though.


SyncEvolution 0.3, 2006-06-27
-----------------------------

* added syncing of calendars and tasks as iCalendar 2.0
* added syncing of contacts as vCard 3.0
* tested extensively with sync.scheduleworld.com and
  added an example configuration for it
* uses C++ client library revision "wmplugin_3_0_20"
  which contains several bug fixes, among them proper
  support for special characters and memory handling
  fixes
* much nicer listing of changes made during a sync,
  handled by the improved "synccompare" utility script
  (formerly known as "normalize_vcard")
* improved automated testing


SyncEvolution 0.2, 2006-03-19
-----------------------------

* added automatic backup mechanism and log storage,
  see "Automatic Backups and Logging".
* output no longer is the original log data, but rather
  a human-readable report of errors and synchronization
  results.
* "normalize_vcard" can now also compare two .vcf files
  directly.
* improved unit tests to catch more errors
* hide certain differences in vcards coming back from
  the server: duplication of extended vcard properties,
  missing TYPE=OTHER
* fixed client library problems:
  see http://forge.objectweb.org/tracker/?group_id=96&atid=100096
      #304792, #304829
* added some more problems to the "Known Problems" section


SyncEvolution 0.1, 2006-03-13
-----------------------------

* initial release
